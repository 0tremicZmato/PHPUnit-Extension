Materialise has recently released a new version of Mimics, called 14 01, which introduces several improvements and new features. Some of the highlights of this update are:
 
- A new module for cardiac analysis, which enables users to segment and measure the heart chambers, valves, and vessels from cardiac CT or MRI images.
- A new module for lung analysis, which allows users to segment and quantify the lung lobes, segments, and airways from chest CT images.
- A new module for dental analysis, which helps users to segment and analyze the teeth and jaw bones from dental CT images.
- An improved module for bone analysis, which offers more options for bone density measurement, fracture detection, and implant fitting.
- An enhanced user interface, which simplifies the workflow and provides more customization options.

Materialise Mimics 14 01 is compatible with Windows 7, 8.1, and 10 operating systems. It requires a minimum of 8 GB of RAM and a graphics card with OpenGL 3.3 support. Users can download the software from the Materialise website[^4^] or request a free trial version[^2^].
 
Materialise Mimics is part of the Materialise Mimics Innovation Suite (MIS), which also includes other software tools for medical image processing, such as 3-matic Medical, Mimics Enlight, and Mimics inPrint. MIS is the industry standard for medical image-based engineering and has been used in over 14,000 peer-reviewed papers[^1^].
  
Another software tool that is part of the Materialise Mimics Innovation Suite is 3-matic Medical, which allows users to optimize and edit 3D models for various applications, such as finite element analysis (FEA), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), additive manufacturing (AM), or virtual reality (VR).
 
Some of the features of 3-matic Medical are:

- A module for FEA, which enables users to perform stress and strain analysis on 3D models, such as bones, implants, or vessels.
- A module for CFD, which allows users to simulate fluid flow and pressure in 3D models, such as heart valves, stents, or aneurysms.
- A module for AM, which helps users to prepare 3D models for printing, such as repairing defects, reducing file size, adding support structures, or optimizing orientation.
- A module for VR, which lets users to visualize and interact with 3D models in a virtual environment, such as exploring anatomy, planning surgery, or training scenarios.

Materialise 3-matic Medical is compatible with Windows 7, 8.1, and 10 operating systems. It requires a minimum of 8 GB of RAM and a graphics card with OpenGL 3.3 support. Users can download the software from the Materialise website[^2^] or request a free trial version[^2^].
 
Materialise 3-matic Medical is designed to work seamlessly with Materialise Mimics and other software tools in the Materialise Mimics Innovation Suite. Together, they provide a comprehensive solution for medical image-based engineering and 3D printing.
